# 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) – Lab Manual

This repository contains **week-wise solutions** to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** Lab Manual as part of my college coursework. Each week includes **three problems** focused on core algorithmic strategies such as **Divide and Conquer**, **Greedy Algorithms**, **Dynamic Programming**, and **Backtracking**.
