# DAA Codes Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** lab assignments. It includes C++ implementations of algorithms and problem-solving techniques covered in my college coursework.

## Topics Covered

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal’s, Prim’s, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), etc.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, etc.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Closest Pair of Points, Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication, etc.
